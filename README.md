## General Information
##### Have you ever tried to come up with a password that doesn't include any personal information about yourself?
##### How many times have you come across passwords that are 1234 or 0000?
Passwords are undoubtedly essential to security, but let's be honest!, they are difficult to create most of the times. A password generator is very useful, especially if you are working with sensitive information.  You might be thinking that you can come up with a strong password, memorize it, then use it everywhere you need a passsword. That sounds good at first, but you run the risk that a breach one site may expose all your accounts. This situation may become worse if you have the same password for work and your personal affairs. A password generator uses random strings of characters to create a strong password and can be based on a few security criteria that may be stipluated by your employer. Good passwords reduce the likelihood of a hacker cracking your password and gaining access to your device. It is also crucialto  remember that you have to safegaurd your password as well.

Javascript is really the star of this project.

The key features of this project is that it will generate a password that:
* Satisifies general password length criteria which is minimum 8 to 128 characters in length. The user is given a prompt to select the password length and is given an alert if the length doesn't match the criteria.
* The password generated can use a combination of characters. The user must confirm if they would like to include include numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters and special character like commas, star and percent sign. At least one character type should be selected.
* The characters are random.

As a result the password generated will be complex and will require more time for hackers to guess.
